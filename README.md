PunchoutAnywhereMod - v 1.0 by Apache Thunder.

Features:

* Ability to start the Rat Punchout fight anytime. Just type "playpunchout" to start it.
A new custom floor layout will spawn on the floor you are on and will be teleported over to it.
It has most of the stuff the original rat floor had minus the enemies/maze and boss fight. :D

Note that you should not attempt to run the command from the breach.
